grunt-jekyll-boilerplate
========================

## Starter files for new projects using Grunt and Jekyll.

Along with some working knowledge of what they are and how to use them, you'll need to have the following installed for this to work:

* SASS - http://sass-lang.com
* Jekyll - http://jekyllrb.com
* Grunt - http://gruntjs.com

### To run:

Open up Terminal and navigate to the root folder and start Jekyll with:

> jekyll serve --watch

Then navigate into the _grunt folder and run Grunt:

> grunt watch

From there, you should be able to view the default index page by going to http://localhost:4000/ in your browser. Update localhost with your computer's IP address to view it on other computers or devices on your network.
